# Final Project - End-to-End Entity-Relationship (E-R) Data Analysis Workflow
***Disclaimer: This repository is public to showcase skills developed from this assignment. I am in no way reponsible for any academic integrity issues should any code be re-used or copied from any part of this assignment.**

## Motivation
This application was created to satisfy the requirements the final project in my `CSCE 411: Data Modeling for Systems Development` class at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The project required the following three components:
- E-R Database (well-designed following the steps of Data Modeling discussed in class)
- Web Application
- Data Analysis & Visualization

The goal of the project was to facilitate the process of deriving business intelligence from a large dataset. With the dataset, we were to implement and empasize the following techniques that we learned in class:
- Data Analysis using Data Modeling techniques such as clustering, anomaly detection and visualization techniques.
- Emphasize the efficiency improvement of the analysis (both algorithmic and data model based)
- Store data in a database (NoSQL/MySQL/graph stores or some combinations) by following the principles of end-to-end data analysis workflow. You must be able to justify your modeling decisions.
- Enable web-based visualization by creating a JavaScript based web-application. You may use D3 API for visualization.

## Technologies
### Data Preprocessing
* Python?
### Back-End
* Node.js
    * [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
* PostgreSQL?
    * [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/)
    * [pgAdmin 4](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)
### Front-End
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

## Getting Started
In order to use the application locally, you'll need to do a few things first.

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into the repository's directory
```
git clone https://github.com/msichterman/CSCE411-Assignment4-FinalProject.git && cd ./CSCE411-FinalProject
```

2. Install all of the `node_modules` required for the project. Depending on your computer's configuration, you may need to prefix this command with a `sudo`.
```
npm install
```
or
```
sudo npm install
```

3. Lastly, run the following command to get the project off the ground. This command will not only build your JS files, but it will also auto-compile your files on every file save. This allows for hot reloading on-save when the backend and/or frontend code is updated.

```
npm run start
```

4. Head over to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application live!
